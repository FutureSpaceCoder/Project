## Planning Phase
--------------------------- Rob's Used Car Sales is located in Oso Washington --------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Target audience is those individuals that need a used vehicle. Medium age will be 18 to 65. With low to medium income range. 
2.	People in this range will require a vehicle to go to work, pick up supplies, visit friends/family, and some travel to Everett for college. 
3.	Pains – finding a reliable car that can make the large distance, cost of vehicles, and a visually attractive car to person match. Gains, new car dealership would be closer to their homes (won’t need to travel to different town). They would be more likely to know and trust the sales agents. 
4.	With the website we could have the pictures and properties of all the cars on the lot. They could view the vehicles before having to leave their home (right fit). Apply for financing on the website to see what the price range for those needing a loan.  They could ask questions about the vehicles without having to talk to a sales agent(introverts). For company – advertise specials and encourage those just browsing to come down to the lot. This could lead to sales.
